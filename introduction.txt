INTRODUCTION

The Covid-19 Professional Data Analytics Database is an enterprise-grade SQL project designed to manage a comprehensive dataset of the coronavirus pandemic. This project goes beyond simple tracking by implementing a highly normalized, multi-dimensional schema capable of supporting complex epidemiological research and public health policy analysis.

The database is architected to handle millions of records across diverse metrics. The system is divided into specialized subject areas:
-   **Epidemiology**: Tracking the core spread of the virus (cases, deaths, reproduction rates).
-   **Vaccinations**: Monitoring the global immunization effort, including boosters and daily administration rates.
-   **Healthcare Capacity**: Analyzing hospital and ICU strain against national capacity limits.
-   **Government Response**: Correlating policy stringency indices with infection curves.
-   **Demographics**: Leveraging rich country-level metadata (age structure, comorbidities, GDP) to contextualize health outcomes.

This project demonstrates a professional approach to Database Management, featuring a robust schema design and optimized SQL queries. It serves as a platform for advanced analytics, enabling researchers to uncover deep insights into one of the most significant global events of the 21st century.
